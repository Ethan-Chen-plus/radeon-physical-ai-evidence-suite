## Abstract

Radeon Physical AI Evidence Suite is an integrated embodied-AI workflow for AMD
Radeon GPUs and ROCm. It connects policy training, simulator execution,
closed-loop task evaluation, multi-view rendering, performance telemetry, and
SHA-pinned evidence across five complementary settings: Every Embodied VLA
manipulation, RoboCasa365 household tasks, DexJoCo dexterous multi-task control,
DISCOVERSE simulation and synthetic data, and predictive collision avoidance for
Unitree G1. The system runs PyTorch and JAX workloads on AMD Radeon PRO W7900 and
AMD Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 hardware. Its central contribution is a unified evidence
contract that binds a task protocol, model checkpoint, result JSON, video,
runtime manifest, and hash list. The strongest focused result is a SmolVLA
checkpoint with 57/60 strict physical successes. At benchmark scale, the suite
evaluates GR00T and Pi0.5 on the same RoboCasa365 16-task x 50-episode protocol,
reproduces DexJoCo Pi0.5 on native ROCm JAX 0.10, validates DISCOVERSE task and
3DGS paths, and records an 8/8 predictive-CBF Unitree G1 replay panel. The result
is a reusable AMD Physical AI engineering stack, a public model and evidence
release, and a 4:59 English demonstration film.

## 1. Target Application

### 1.1 Problem

Physical AI projects usually cross several execution layers: simulator physics,
camera rendering, data generation, model training, action decoding, closed-loop
control, and result presentation. A workflow can appear functional while still
failing at a contract boundary such as camera order, action normalization,
controller dimensions, or task success semantics. Porting these stacks to a new
GPU platform adds framework and kernel compatibility work on top of robotics
integration.

The target application is a reproducible AMD-native laboratory for household and
dexterous robot learning. It supports three practical uses:

- train and evaluate robot policies on AMD Radeon GPUs;
- migrate representative simulators and rendering paths to ROCm;
- publish results as linked, machine-checkable evidence rather than isolated
  screenshots or unversioned claims.

### 1.2 Flagship scenario

The flagship scenario evaluates released GR00T and Pi0.5 household policies on
the same RoboCasa365 protocol: 16 tasks, 50 closed-loop episodes per task, native
task predicates, and synchronized four-view video. The task set covers cabinet,
drawer, refrigerator, toaster, sink, dishwasher, sorting, and placement
operations.

### 1.3 Design objectives

| Objective | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Broad AMD coverage | PyTorch ROCm, JAX ROCm, MuJoCo/EGL, Genesis AMD, 3DGS |
| Closed-loop robotics | Simulator state advances from model actions until task termination |
| Reproducible results | Fixed seeds, explicit denominators, JSON summaries, checkpoint hashes |
| Reviewable media | Success-first multi-view videos with English narration and subtitles |
| Reusable engineering | Public setup, training, evaluation, profiling, and validation scripts |

<!-- pagebreak -->

## 2. System Architecture

The suite is organized into six layers. Each layer produces an artifact consumed
by the next layer and recorded in the final evidence bundle.

| Layer | Main components | Output contract |
|---|---|---|
| Tasks and assets | RoboCasa365, DexJoCo, DISCOVERSE, Every Embodied, PAC-MAN | task name, robot, cameras, success predicate |
| Data | expert trajectories, LeRobot datasets, benchmark JSON | schema, action semantics, statistics, split |
| Runtime | ROCm PyTorch, ROCm JAX, MuJoCo/EGL, Genesis, 3DGS | device, versions, backend, finite-value gate |
| Models | SmolVLA, Pi0/Pi0.5, ACT, GR00T, predictive CBF | checkpoint, config, normalization, SHA-256 |
| Evaluation | fixed seeds, task-native predicates, stage metrics | per-episode JSON, aggregate score, video |
| Publication | GitHub, Hugging Face, GitHub Pages, HyperFrames | release tag, report, demo, evidence index |

The W7900 is used for long-running model optimization. The Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 is
used for simulator integration, model inference, JAX validation, closed-loop
rollouts, rendering, and profiling. This split makes the same project portable
across a discrete Radeon GPU and a unified-memory AMD workstation.

### 2.1 Evidence contract

For every promoted result, the release preserves:

1. task and seed protocol;
2. exact model or controller identity;
3. software and hardware manifest;
4. per-episode and aggregate result JSON;
5. representative video;
6. SHA-256 hashes for the public artifact set.

The included `validate_public_bundle.py` recomputes headline totals from raw JSON
and verifies the release file hashes. This provides a fast judge path before a
full simulator rerun.

### 2.2 User-facing workflow

The public site defaults to English and presents successful household,
dexterous-hand, simulator, rendering, and humanoid-safety examples first. Detailed
benchmark tables, migration notes, reproduction commands, and boundary cases
follow. The 4:59 film uses the same archived media and result manifests as the
website.

## 3. Datasets and Task Protocols

### 3.1 Every Embodied MuJoCo cup manipulation

The SmolVLA workflow uses two language-conditioned variants: place a red mug on
a plate and place a blue mug on a plate. Evaluation uses 30 fixed seeds per
color. A success requires the physical placement predicate, including lift and
stable placement, to pass. The protected weighted continuation checkpoint is
evaluated on all 60 episodes.

![SmolVLA red mug success](docs/figures/smolvla-cup-success.jpg)

### 3.2 RoboCasa365

The official fixed-arm evaluation uses 16 tasks with 50 episodes per task for
each model. GR00T and Pi0.5 use the same task directories and denominator, which
supports direct comparison. The tasks span opening, closing, placement,
cleaning, sorting, and appliance interactions.

The official PandaOmron runtime gate additionally validates a 12-dimensional
hybrid action contract and three-camera observation path on AMD hardware.

### 3.3 DexJoCo

DexJoCo contributes 11 dexterous tasks, including bimanual assembly, Hanoi,
microwave use, photography, mouse clicking, folding glasses, hammering, bucket
pickup, tong pinching, tablet unlocking, and plant watering. The formal panel
uses the official multi-task Pi0.5 checkpoint, one episode per task, and seed 0.
A separate success-seed archive evaluates fixed seeds 1-10 and stores the first
successful rollout available for each additional task.

![DexJoCo bucket pickup](docs/figures/dexjoco-pick-bucket.jpg)

### 3.4 DISCOVERSE and predictive safety

DISCOVERSE coverage includes AIRBOT, MMK2, expert trajectory generation,
multi-camera rendering, and 3D Gaussian Splatting. The public HD set contains
four official MMK2 state-machine tasks with three native 1920x1080 cameras.

The Unitree G1 safety panel uses eight fixed seeds and predictive perpendicular
control-barrier filtering. Each episode records minimum clearance, filtered
speed, lateral displacement, threat duration, and escape direction.

## 4. AMD Radeon and ROCm Implementation

### 4.1 Hardware

| Platform | GPU memory | Workloads in this submission |
|---|---:|---|
| AMD Radeon PRO W7900 | 48 GiB | SmolVLA training, ACT training, long policy runs |
| AMD Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 / Radeon 8060S | unified memory | PyTorch and JAX inference, evaluation, MuJoCo, RoboCasa, DexJoCo, DISCOVERSE, 3DGS |

### 4.2 PyTorch ROCm

The Every Embodied path records PyTorch 2.11.0 with HIP 7.13. The established
PyTorch `cuda` API is used by ROCm, so policies select `cuda:0` while the runtime
reports an AMD device. Integration work includes uint8 image preprocessing,
legacy LeRobot package compatibility, action-chunk timing, headless rendering,
and high-frequency telemetry.

### 4.3 Native JAX ROCm

DexJoCo Pi0.5 runs in an isolated Python 3.12 environment with ROCm 7.14.0,
JAX 0.10.0, and JAXlib 0.10.0. The GPU is visible as `rocm:0` on gfx1151. A
64x64 matrix preflight verifies XLA execution before model loading. The official
multi-task weights, tokenizer, normalization statistics, environment, and
closed-loop policy are then loaded in that environment.

### 4.4 Simulation and rendering

RoboCasa and RoboSuite use MuJoCo with EGL off-screen rendering. DISCOVERSE uses
MuJoCo-based robot environments plus AMD PyTorch model paths. Genesis workloads
select the AMD backend where supported. The 3DGS path validates more than one
million Gaussian points for each of two renderer targets and exports dynamic
Franka and UR5e videos.

### 4.5 Measured SmolVLA performance on AMD395

| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| Six-episode physical gate | 6/6 |
| Episode elapsed mean / p95 | 6.547 s / 9.066 s |
| Aggregate simulator throughput | 518.736 sim steps/s |
| Aggregate control throughput | 20.646 action steps/s |
| Full VLA forward mean / p95 | 438.332 ms / 440.883 ms |
| Peak sampled GPU use | 61% |
| Peak sampled VRAM use | 11% |

## 5. Model Training and Evaluation

### 5.1 SmolVLA

The main SmolVLA model uses a 5,000-step parent run followed by a 500-step
weighted continuation. The training workflow records loss, optimizer state,
normalization statistics, checkpoint metadata, and progress. The selected
checkpoint is then loaded into a fresh process for the 60-episode physical gate.

### 5.2 Pi0/Pi0.5, ACT, and GR00T

Pi0 and ACT are included as policy training and evaluation paths. The protected
Pi0 candidate reaches 12/14 on its focused fresh panel, including 9/10 unseen
episodes. RoboCasa365 uses the released multi-task GR00T and Pi0.5 checkpoints
to measure broad household task performance on an identical 800-episode
protocol.

DexJoCo uses the released multi-task Pi0.5 checkpoint for native ROCm JAX
closed-loop evaluation. RoboWits adds complete ACT training, checkpointing,
inference, and video tooling on W7900 for unexpected-condition manipulation.

### 5.3 Closed-loop evaluation

A rollout advances the simulator from model actions until the task horizon or
success condition. The evaluator saves the seed, task, number of steps, success
predicate, video path, and timing. Multi-task totals are computed from the
per-task records rather than entered manually.

### 5.4 Multi-view media

RoboCasa365 exports four-view 1920x1080 household videos. DISCOVERSE exports
three native 1080p camera streams and a review composite. DexJoCo publishes one
representative success video for each task with an observed success seed. The
demo film uses these source clips directly and provides phrase-aligned English
narration and subtitles.

## 6. Results

### 6.1 Focused VLA result

| Model | Protocol | Result |
|---|---|---:|
| SmolVLA weighted500 | red/blue physical gate, 30 seeds each | **57/60 (95.0%)** |
| Pi0 S8500 | fresh 14-episode focused panel | **12/14 (85.7%)** |

SmolVLA records 27/30 for the red task and 30/30 for the blue task. This is the
primary learned-policy result because it combines a released checkpoint, a
nontrivial denominator, strict physical success, and representative videos.

### 6.2 RoboCasa365 broad household benchmark

| Model | Tasks | Episodes | Successes | Success rate |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| GR00T | 16 | 800 | **230** | **28.75%** |
| Pi0.5 | 16 | 800 | **142** | **17.75%** |

GR00T's strongest tasks include CloseFridge at 39/50, OpenCabinet at 32/50,
ScrubCuttingBoard at 26/50, and CloseToasterOvenDoor at 24/50. Pi0.5 records
33/50 on SlideDishwasherRack, 31/50 on PickPlaceDrawerToCounter, 25/50 on
OpenDrawer, and 20/50 on OpenCabinet.

### 6.3 Dexterous and simulator results

| Workstream | Protocol | Result |
|---|---|---:|
| DexJoCo Pi0.5 | official multi-task seed 0 | **5/11** |
| DexJoCo success-seed archive | fixed seed search 0-10 | success examples for **10/11** tasks |
| DISCOVERSE HD MMK2 | four official state-machine tasks | **4/4** |
| DISCOVERSE task migration | AIRBOT and MMK2 gates | AIRBOT **12/12**, MMK2 **8/8** |
| Unitree G1 predictive CBF | fixed seeds 0-7 | **8/8**, minimum clearance **0.422 m** |

## 7. Innovations and Technical Contributions

### 7.1 Cross-framework AMD execution

The project demonstrates both ROCm PyTorch and native ROCm JAX in robot policy
workloads. This is valuable for Physical AI because current VLA ecosystems are
split across the two frameworks. The suite also integrates MuJoCo/EGL, Genesis,
and 3DGS into the same AMD-oriented release.

### 7.2 One evidence model across heterogeneous benchmarks

Each component uses its native task predicate, but publication follows one
contract: protocol, checkpoint, manifest, result JSON, media, and SHA. The
validator can recompute headline numbers from the submitted JSON. This makes a
large multi-project submission reviewable without flattening all tasks into an
invalid combined score.

### 7.3 Household benchmark and mobile runtime integration

The RoboCasa work combines a matched 1,600-episode household benchmark with the
official PandaOmron runtime gate. The release validates model loading, native
task predicates, four-view video, the 12-D mobile controller, and the
three-camera observation path on AMD395.

### 7.4 Success-first visual evidence

The public site and film bring together DexJoCo dexterous interactions,
RoboCasa household workflows, DISCOVERSE multi-view tasks, 3DGS rendering, and
Unitree G1 predictive safety. HyperFrames and FFmpeg generate a deterministic
4:59 film with English narration, synchronized subtitles, and stable hashes.

### 7.5 Open educational value

The release includes public SmolVLA, Pi0, ACT, and RoboWits model repositories,
native training notebooks, AMD setup notes, profiling scripts, evaluation
scripts, and an English engineering website. These materials let learners run
a trained policy first, inspect a successful video, then repeat training and
evaluation on AMD hardware.
